# Financial Data Analysis Portfolio

This project serves as a Financial Data Analysis portfolio, leveraging Python's powerful data analysis and visualization libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The portfolio guides users through the complete workflow of financial data analysis.

## Project Workflow

1. **Download Sample Datasets**:  
   Start by sourcing and downloading financial datasets from trusted public repositories or any sample provided for this project.

2. **Perform Data Cleaning**:  
   Clean dataset files to handle:
   - Missing values
   - Duplicate records
   - Data type inconsistencies

3. **Conduct Data Analysis**:  
   Use Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to:
   - Summarize data
   - Generate statistical insights such as means, medians, and correlations.

4. **Create Visualizations**:  
   Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn to create:
   - Line plots
   - Bar charts
   - Heatmaps for deeper insights.
